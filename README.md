# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Task 2 (Future Interns)

This project predicts customer churn using a real-world telecom dataset. It includes complete data preprocessing, feature engineering, visualization, class balancing using SMOTE, and evaluation of three powerful models: **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

## 📎 How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab:  
   [Click here to run in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/your-repo-name/blob/main/Churn_Prediction_Task2.ipynb)

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the notebook cells step by step to:
   - Load and clean the dataset  
   - Explore and visualize key patterns  
   - Train models and evaluate performance

## 📂 Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is from the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://github.com/MohElaghory/Telco-Customer-Churn), which contains customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Long-term contracts** significantly reduce churn likelihood.  
- Customers with more add-on services (like Tech Support, Online Backup) are **less likely** to churn.  
- **MonthlyCharges** and **tenure** have a strong correlation with churn behavior.
